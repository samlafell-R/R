## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Getting Started

First, we start with...
```{r}
View(kobe_basket)
```

kobe_basket has 133 observations and 6 variables.
The "shot" variable has H or M for hit or miss.

1. Fill in the blank: A streak of length 1 means one __ followed by one miss.
A: hit
2. Fill in the blank: A streak length of 0 means one __ which must occur after a miss that ended the preceeding streak.
A: miss

We can use calc_streak() to calculate the longest streaks in the shot column.
```{r}
kobe_streak <- calc_streak(kobe_basket$shot)
table(kobe_streak)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = kobe_streak, aes(x = length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
```

3.  Which of the following is false about the distribution of Kobe's streak lengths 
from the 2009 NBA finals. 
<ol>
<li> The distribution of Kobe's streaks is unimodal and right skewed. </li>
<li> The typical length of a streak is 0 since the median of the distribution is at 0. </li>
<li> The IQR of the distribution is 1. 
<li> The longest streak of baskets is of length 4. </li>
<li> The shortest streak is of length 1.</li>
</ol>

A: 5. The shortest streak is of length 1.

## Compared to What?
Are these streaks long enough to support the belief he had hot hands?
Let's talk about *independence*.
Two processes are independent if the outcome of one provides us literally 0 information about the outcome of another.

A shooter with a hot hand will have shots that are _not_ independent of one another. The hot hand model says he'll have a higher probability of making his second if he makes his first. (THINK  BAYES)

## Simulations in R
We don't have any data from non-hot hand shooters, but that's easy to simulate. We just have to set ground rules and then the computer uses random numbers to generate an outcome.

Example: Simulate coin flipping
```{r}
coin_outcomes <- c("heads", "tails")
sample(coin_outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
```
We can run this several times and see the outcome changes between heads and tails.

What if we wanted to simulate 100 times? CHILDS PLAY
```{r}
sim_fair_coin <- sample(coin_outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
sim_fair_coin
table(sim_fair_coin)
```

What if we don't want the probabilities to be even? Oh man. Even easier.
```{r}
sim_unfair_coin <- sample(coin_outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.8))
table(sim_unfair_coin)
```
That's just straight up magic.
Remember we can do ?sample to get help

## Simulating the Independent Shooter
Let's simulate 1 shot from a shooter with 50% shooting percentage.
```{r}
shot_outcomes <- c("H", "M")
sim_basket <- sample(shot_outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
sim_basket
```

What changes needs to be made to sample to make it reflect a shooting percentage of 45%? Make this adjustment then run a simulation to sample 133 shots. Assign output to sim_basket

```{r}
sim_basket <- sample(shot_outcomes, size = 133, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.45, 0.55))
table(sim_basket)
```
Now we have the data to compare Kobe to our Independent Shooter! Woohoo!

## Comparing Kobe Bryant to the Independent Shooter
<div id="exercise">
**Exercise**: Using `calc_streak`, compute the streak lengths of `sim_basket`, and save the results in a data frame called `sim_streak`. Note that since the `sim_streak` object is just a vector and not a variable in a data frame, we don't need to first select it from a data frame like we did earlier when we calculated the streak lengths for Kobe's shots.
</div>

```{r}
sim_streak <- calc_streak(sim_basket)
table(sim_streak)
ggplot(sim_streak, aes(x=length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

4.  If you were to run the simulation of the independent shooter a second time, how 
would you expect its streak distribution to compare to the distribution from the 
exercise above? 
<ol>
<li> Exactly the same  </li>
<li> Somewhat similar </li>
<li> Totally different </li>
</ol>

A: 2. Somewhat Similar


5.  How does Kobe Bryant's distribution of streak lengths compare to the distribution 
of streak lengths for the simulated shooter? Using this comparison, do you have 
evidence that the hot hand model fits Kobe's shooting patterns?
<ol>
<li> The distributions look very similar. Therefore, there doesn't appear to be evidence for Kobe Bryant's hot hand. </li>
<li> The distributions look very similar. Therefore, there appears to be evidence for Kobe Bryant's hot hand. </li>
<li> The distributions look very different. Therefore, there doesn't appear to be evidence for Kobe Bryant's hot hand. </li>
<li> The distributions look very different. Therefore, there appears to be evidence for Kobe Bryant's hot hand. </li>
</ol>

Personally, we don't have enough information to say whether there is or isn't a difference. **The graphs and tables begin to suggest evidence for the hot hand.**
