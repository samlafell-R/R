This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# 3.7 -- Statistical Transformations
Diamonds data set.
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

Cut on the x-axis. Count on the y-axis. But Count is not a variable!
Bar Charts calculates a robust summary of the distribution and then displays a specially formatted box.
Called _'stat'_, short for Statistical Trnasformation

## Exercise 3.7.1
### 1. 
What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?
  -- geom_pointrange is associated with stat_summary
  -- https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/stat_summary.html
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_pointrange(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    stat = "summary",
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

### 2.
What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?

geom_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group
  -- bar doesn't need a y variable
geom_col() lets the height of the bars represent values in the data
  -- col needs a y variable

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = color))
```

### 3. 
Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?
geom_bar = stat_count
geom_freqpoly = stat_bin
geom_col = stat_identity
geom_point = stat_identity
geom_pointrange = stat_identity

### 4.
What variables does ```{r} stat_smooth()``` compute? What parameters control its behavior?
```{r}
stat_smooth(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, geom = "smooth",
    position = "identity", method = "auto",
    formula = y ~ x, se = TRUE, n = 80, fullrange = FALSE,
    level = 0.95, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
```

```{r}
c <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(qsec, wt))
c + stat_smooth()
c + stat_smooth() + geom_point()
```

stat_smooth() computes the smoothing function to use, for example, Generalized Linear Model, Linear Model, Generalized Additive Model, Loess Model, RLM.

The parameters above control its behavior, but n is very important. With n < 1000, it uses Loess. For n > 1000, it uses GAM.

### 5.
In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..))
```

In these two graphs, we are shown the Color as proportions, but the proportions aren't being limited by n. We need to set group = 1 to make sure that each bar has proportions that combine to equal 1.

# 3.8 -- Position Adjustments
You can colour a bar chart using fill and colour.
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, colour = cut))
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut))
```

Or you can fill to another variable...
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

Position = "fill" works like stacking but makes the bars the same height. Easier to compare across groups.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill")
```

Position = "dodge" places overlapping objects directly beside one another. Easier to compare individual values

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")
```

Remember from ...
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
There are only 126 points for 234 observations. This is because there is _overplotting_ rounds the points and makes it hard to see where the mass is.
So, we need to jitter the points to add in some variation and see the points.
```{r}
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = "jitter")
```

## 3.8.1 Exercises
### 1.
What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```

Add jitter to the points
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
```

### 2.
What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering?
Width, Height
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(width = .8, height = .3)
```

### 3.
Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count()
?geom_jitter
?geom_count
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) +
 geom_count() +
 scale_size_area()
```

geom_jitter moves the points around, while geom_count changes the size of each point based on how many counts have been rounded to that point.

### 4.
What's the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()? Create a visualization of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it
?geom_boxplot
position = "dodge2"
data(mpg)
```{r}
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy, group = cyl))
```
It compares the highway mileages of different cylinders all on the same graph.

# 3.9 -- Coordinate Systems

coord_flip() switches the x and y axes.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
ggplot(mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

coord_quickmap() sets the aspect ratio correctly for maps!!
```{r}
nz <- map_data("nz")
ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "black")
ggplot(nz, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "black") +
  coord_quickmap()
```
So that's not working, anyway, moving on.
