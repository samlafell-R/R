# R
In March 2019, I began learning R.

My first effort was to begin reading Hadley Wickham's, "R for Data Science". Of which, I am still working on as of May 2019.

I have also completed Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression sections in "Machine Learning A-Z" on Udemy. I completed these sections in Python and R.

I look to find a home within Python, R, or SAS. As a student in the Institute for Advanced Analytics, I utilize all 3 tools and need to be flexible with my tool of choice. My focus is currently in R, but will shift to SAS in June 2019 because of the IAA.
