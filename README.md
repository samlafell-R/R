# R
In March 2019, I began learning R.

My first effort was to begin reading Hadley Wickham's, "R for Data Science".
I have also completed Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression sections in "Machine Learning A-Z" on Udemy. I completed these sections in Python and R.

As a student at the Institute for Advanced Analytics, I have begun to find more of a home in R compared to other languages. The ease of use of R Notebooks makes it a very attractive option.
